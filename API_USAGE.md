# API Usage

The resources found on this repository can be fetched through our public API.

Observe that, due to the dynamic nature of the project, resources categories can be updated at any given time. If you rely on the categories to remain the same, ideally you should freeze the data on your end and periodically check for new additions/edits and structural changes.

## List all resources

`https://api.devresourc.es/v1/list-all`

## List available categories

`https://api.devresourc.es/v1/list-categories`

_Use these values to fetch a single category, like in the example below_

## List resources from a single category

`https://api.devresourc.es/v1/list?category=assets-icons`

## Check if API is up

`https://api.devresourc.es/v1/ping`
